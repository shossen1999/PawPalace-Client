# PetMarket

## Concept
PetMarket is a platform with two types of users: **admins** and **regular users**. Users can add pets, which require **admin approval** before being listed. Pets can be **donated** or **sold**, and users can open **donation campaigns** for their own pets. The system can **send reminders** to adopters or buyers before a pet's **vaccination date** .
